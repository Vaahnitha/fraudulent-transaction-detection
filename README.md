This is a farud detection system for banks which helps detect fraudulent transactions real time. This project has been developed for a hackathon and will be refined further.
After preprocessing the data, to address bias in the dataset (As fraudulent transactions are very few when compared to legitimate transactions), synthetic data has been produced using GAN.
The sythetic data is then combined with real data to train the ensemble model.
still under work!
